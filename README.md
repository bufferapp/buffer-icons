# Buffer Icon Fonts

## Purpose

Buffer Icon Fonts is a fast, easy and flexible font generator for creating custom icon based webfonts for use across all devices.

## How to use

The Buffer Icon Font generator is based off of the work done at https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont.

As such there is a couple installations required to generate your own fonts which you can view here https://github.com/sapegin/grunt-webfont#installation.

And install the rest of the dependencies by running `npm install`.

Once all the dependencies are installed you simply add the `.svg` files you want
to be included into the font into the 'src/icons' directory and run the `grunt` command.

And thats it!

The font, less and html files can be found in the `dist` directory.
